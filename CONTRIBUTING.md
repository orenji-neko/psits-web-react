## 🔀 Branching & Workflow

We use a simple workflow: **master + staging + feature branches**.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Fork** the repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. In your fork, **create a new branch from `staging`**.
3. Implement your changes on that branch.
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `staging`** in the original repository.
5. **QA tests** features in the staging environment.
6. If approved, changes are **merged from `staging` to `master`**.

### 🏷️ Branch Naming

Use clear, conventional prefixes:

- `feat/your-feature`
- `fix/bug-description`
- `refactor/area`
- `docs/section`
- Optionally: `chore/`, `perf/`, `ci/`, `test/`, `security/`

## 📝 Commit Style (Conventional Commits)

Prefix your commits with a type and short subject:

- `feat: add membership approval flow`
- `fix: correct order receipt rendering`
- `refactor: streamline event controller`
- `docs: update README tech stack`
- Optional types: `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `test`, `security`

Keep messages concise and descriptive. Use imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix").

## ✅ Pull Request Rules

- **Target branch:** `staging`
- **Approvals:** At least **1 reviewer** must approve before merge
- **Merging:** Use standard merge or squash per maintainer guidance
- **No direct pushes to `master`**
- Provide a clear PR description (scope, changes, any risks)

## 🧪 Build & Test Before PR

Build and test both client and server locally before opening a PR. Refer to each package's `package.json` for exact commands.

Recommended flow:

### 💻 Client-side

- Development (iterate locally):

```bash
cd client-side
npm run dev
```

- Pre-PR production sanity (test build output):

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 🖥️ Server-side

- Development (iterate locally with hot reload):

```bash
cd server-side
npm run dev
```

- Pre-PR production sanity (run compiled code):

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Ensure changes run cleanly in development and also work in the production build without errors.
